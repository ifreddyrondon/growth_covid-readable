# growth_covid-readable

This is just a bunch of code to share with people who want to improve their readable skill in go.

The basic idea is to improve this code in the way you want. They're some thoughts and ideas when you run the code.
I do not really accept contributions, since this is not something ready to be seen by your judgemental eyes ðŸ˜†

## How can I play with this?

Just clone this repo and give it some love. Don't forget to run for some innovative ideas jeje.
